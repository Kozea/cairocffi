Decoding images with GDK-PixBuf
===============================

The
:meth:`ImageSurface.create_from_png() <cairocffi.ImageSurface.create_from_png>`
method can decode PNG images and provide a cairo surface,
but what about other image formats?

The :mod:`cairocffi.pixbuf` module uses GDK-PixBuf_
to decode JPEG, GIF, and various other formats (depending on what is installed.)
If you donâ€™t import this module,
it is possible to use the rest of cairocffi without having GDK-PixBuf installed.
GDK-PixBuf is an independent package since version 2.22,
but before that was part of `GTK+`_.

.. _GDK-PixBuf: https://live.gnome.org/GdkPixbuf
.. _GTK+: http://www.gtk.org/

This module also converts pixel data
since the internal format in GDK-PixBuf (big-endian RGBA)
is not the same as in cairo (native-endian ARGB).
For this reason, although it is a "toy" API,
:meth:`ImageSurface.create_from_png() <cairocffi.ImageSurface.create_from_png>`
can be faster than :func:`decode_to_image_surface`
if the format is known to be PNG.
The pixel conversion is done by GTK+ if available,
but a (slower) fallback method is used otherwise.
